# SVENMultiSearch.html
## Introduction
This Swedish-English Multi-Search tool was inspired by the contributors to https://fluent-forever.com/ and by the Duolingo
Swedish-English Team.  Currently, this tool searches 10 websites for Swedish words.  The tool also has a button 
for clearing the tabs for previous multi-searches.  I have used this tool when creating my own Swedish Anki decks (http://ankisrs.net/).  

Upon opening with Chrome or Firefox, this window appears:

## Accessing the Tool
To access this tool:

1. click on the SVENMultiSearch.html file in the SV_Multi_Search repository  
2. with the '<> Code' tab selected, select and copy the code   
3. paste it into a text editor (I use Notepad)   
4. save the file with an .html extension  

OR

1. click on the SVENMultiSearch.html file in the SV_Multi_Search repository  
2. with the '<> Code' tab selected, click on the 'Raw' button    
3. the raw file will open in your browser     
4. right-click in the open window and save the file with an .html extension  

## Issues
While this tool works just fine when opened with Chrome and Firefox, the 'Click Here to Delete Tabs for Previous Multi-Searches' button does not function in Microsoft Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge.  You must 'Allow Pop-up Windows' in IE and Edge for all 10 tabs to appear.
