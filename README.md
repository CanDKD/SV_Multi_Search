# SVENMultiSearch.html
## Introduction
This Swedish-English Multi-Search tool was inspired by the contributors to https://fluent-forever.com/ and by the Duolingo
Swedish-English Team.  Currently, this tool searches 14 websites for Swedish words.  The tool also has a button 
for clearing the tabs for previous multi-searches.  I have used this tool when creating my own Swedish Anki decks (http://ankisrs.net/).  

Upon opening the SVENMultiSearch file in your browser (I use Chrome or Firefox), this window appears:

## Accessing the Tool
To access this tool:

1. click on the SVENMultiSearch.html file in the SV_Multi_Search repository  
2. with the '<> Code' tab selected, click on the 'Raw' button    
3. the raw file will open in your browser     
4. right-click in the open window and save the file with an .html extension  

## Issues
For this tool to work properly, you will need to add the SVENMultiSearch file to your Pop Up Blocker exceptions list.  This is easy to do in Chrome and Firefox - when you first try to run the tool a Pop Up Blocker window will appear (if you have activated your pop up blocker) giving you the option to add the SVENMultiSearch file to the exception list. Once you have done this, re-run the tool and all the functionality of the tool should work.  I have not yet figured out how to set up Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge so that the tool works properly.
