## Introduction
This Swedish-English Multi-Search tool was inspired by the contributors to https://fluent-forever.com/ and by the Duolingo
Swedish-English Team.  Currently, this tool searches 10 websites for Swedish words.  The tool also has a button 
for clearing the tabs for previous multi-searches.  I have used this tool when creating my own Swedish Anki decks (http://ankisrs.net/).  

Upon opening with Chrome or Firefox, this window appears:
